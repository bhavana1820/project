    <div class="info">
        <p>Deloitte's technology consultancy, a division of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, has evolved significantly since its inception. Established in 1845, Deloitte initially focused on auditing and accounting. Over time, recognizing the growing influence of technology, Deloitte expanded its services. In the 1990s, amid the tech boom, Deloitte began offering comprehensive technology consulting services, addressing the increasing needs for IT strategy, systems integration, and data analytics. The acquisition of firms like Monitor Group in 2013 and the establishment of Deloitte Digital in 2012 marked its commitment to digital transformation and innovation. Today, Deloitte Technology Consulting is renowned for its expertise in cloud computing, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and blockchain, serving a wide array of industries globally. This transformation has positioned Deloitte as a leader in technology consultancy, blending deep industry knowledge with cutting-edge technological solutions to help clients navigate the complexities of the digital age.</p>
